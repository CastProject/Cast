Cast is an open-standard for Discord bots, allowing developers to create a single plugin that is compatible with many different bots that all share the same plugin API.

## Documentation

All of the documentation for Cast is available [here](https://castproject.github.io/Cast) - the quality is subpar but our documentation generator will be improved soon.

## How can I support Cast plugins?

Simple! Implement all of the interfaces supplied by Cast. If done correctly, loading a Cast plugin should run flawlessly after implementing everything. Just follow the standard and refer to the docs when you're confused.
